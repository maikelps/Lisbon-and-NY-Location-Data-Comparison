# Lisbon-and-NY-Location-Data-Comparison

Hello reader,

Thank you for reading this project. The present repository is required as final for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate from Coursera.

The requirements are to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

## Introduction

Since I've been living in Lisbon for two years now, It's almost impossible to not develop a bit of care for this city and most people tend to compare certain characteristics of another big metropolis to it. It is not something rare when these kinds of comparisons arise, if you are a company of certain size looking to install one base of operations or your central headquarters there's so much to consider when committing to such a thing.

Which cities in the world make you consider them as "big metropolis"? there's no doubt that when you try to answer this question that a city like New York, Hong Kong or Paris comes to your mind. Depending on different factors it would make sense to base your operations in certain places instead of others. Maybe you are looking for a great place that presents certain characteristics that indicate that it would make sense to set your operations there and would give you an advantage over your competitors.

Since I have at my disposal location data from Foursquare and Portugal's postal codes it is fair to ask oneself how different is Lisbon from other big cities or even to different cities in Portugal, like its eternal rival, Porto.

## Problem set up and resolution

On this project, I'm going to compare the location data from New York and Lisbon and see how different they are in the types of venues, proportions of those venues and neighborhoods differences. And then, just for fun and, on a local scale, do the same analysis between Porto and Lisbon to provide value to companies having Portugal in their scope for future projects.

The Data that will be used are:
  * Portugal's postal codes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_in_Portugal
  * Location data: https://developer.foursquare.com/

To study each of the neighborhood of the cities we need to get the geographical coordinates of each postal code (a thing we've done before) and compare the top venues types between each. Based on that, draw some conclusions on which city has more types of venues or how different their neighborhoods are in between them.

If you consider it, feel free to send me any feedback or comments on it.

Thanks again.
