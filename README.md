# Lisbon-and-Porto-Location-Data-Comparison

Hello reader,

Thank you for reading this project. The present repository is required as final for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate from Coursera.

The requirements are to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

## Introduction

Since I've been living in Lisbon for two years now, It's almost impossible to not develop a bit of care for this city and most people tend to compare certain characteristics of another big metropolis to it. It is not something rare when these kinds of comparisons arise, if you are someone looking to create a business or know which kind of investment to pursue it can be complicated to make a decision.

Lisbon always gets compared to the rest of the cities in Portugal, but it gets compared a lot with another Portuguese city, Porto.

Since I have at my disposal location data from Foursquare and Portugal's postal codes it is fair to ask oneself how different is Lisbon from Porto.

## Problem set up and resolution

In this project, I'm going to compare the location data from Porto and Lisbon and see how different they are in the types of venues and neighborhoods differences. This project has the intention to provide value to companies or small entrepreneurs having Portugal in their scope for future projects.

The Data that I will use:
  * Portugal's postal codes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_in_Portugal
  * Location data: https://developer.foursquare.com/

To study each of the neighborhood of the cities we need to get the geographical coordinates of each postal code (a thing we've done before) and compare the top venues types between each. Based on that, we can do an analysis and draw some conclusions on which city has more types of venues or how different their neighborhoods are in between them.

#### Comments
If you consider it, feel free to send me any feedback for this project and thanks for the feedback I already got.

Thanks again.
